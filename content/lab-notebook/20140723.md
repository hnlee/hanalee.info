Summary: To do list, notes

## To Do ##

- Autoclave tubes and flasks
- Inoculate single colony for overnight growth
- Find &beta;-mercaptoethanol and prepare Buffer RLT
- Calculate time of incubation to log-phase growth

### Administrivia ###

- Order Illumina Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit

### ASAP ###


### Preparation ###

### Long-term ###

***

## Notes ##

- Ordered Illumina kit
- Autoclaved two 250 mL flasks and 15 mL culture tubes
- Inoculated 5 mL KB with single colony from refrigerated plate and incubated at 28&deg; C overnight:
    - BHL001
    - BHL002
- Found &beta-mercaptoethanol in Long lab and got 900 &micro;L aliquot
- 10 &micro;L/mL so mixed 450 &micro;L &beta;-mercaptoethanol with 45 mL Buffer RLT Plus
- Calculated incubation time based on mean doubling time for the two strains
    - Back-dilution to OD<sub>600</sub> 0.1 and growth to OD<sub>600</sub> 0.8
    - Doubling times based on previous growth curves
        - BHL001: 76.628
        - BHL002: 105.657
        - mean: 91.128
    - Estimated time of incubation: 273.38 m = 4.5 hours
