Summary: To do list, notes
status: draft

## To Do ##

### Administrivia ###

### ASAP ###

- Pour new KB+nitro plates
- Inoculate plants
- GEO upload
- SGRP reference mapping

### Preparation ###

- Troubleshoot allele-specific qPCR
- Download genome sequences of _P. syringae_ isolates
- Find optimal method for isolation of bacterial DNA from plant tissue

### Long-term ###

- Revise Python script for semiautomated colony counting
- Write a LSM to PNG converter?
- Set up infrastructure for sequence analysis

***

## Notes ##

- Back-diluted 1 mL O/N cultures of BHL001 and BHL002 into 4 mL KB
- Incubated at 28&deg; C from 10:45 to 14:45
- Watered flats at greenhouse at 11:15
- Measured OD<sub>600</sub> and normalized to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.2 in
  total 1.5 mL MgSO<sub>4</sub>

Strain | OD<sub>600</sub> 
-------|-----------------:
BHL001 |             0.456
BHL002 |             0.399

Inoculum | OD units | Culture 
---------|---------:|--------:
BHL001   |      0.30|     0.66
BHL002   |      0.30|     0.75
BHL001+2 | 0.15+0.15|0.33+0.38
mock     |       0.0|      0.0

- Thinned second set of flats to one plant per well
- Pipetted 40 &micro;L of each culture onto leaf, 2 leaves/plant, 18
  plants/strain
- Covered with plastic domes and returned to greenhouse
