Summary: To do list, notes

## To Do ##

### Administrivia ###

- Hand in signed form to confocal microscope facility
- Update lab notebook entries

### ASAP ###

- For Malaysian manuscript:
    - Create heat map from qPCR data
- Sow Ga-0 and Col-0 in flats

### Preparation ###
 
- Pour KB+nitro and LB+genta plates
- biocloud install of:
    - `blast`
    - `knitr`
    - `vim-R` and dependencies
- PCR and sequence verification of _P. syringae_ strains
- Test confocal microscope with fluorescent strains

### Long-term ###

- Revise Python script for semiautomated colony counting
- Write a LSM to PNG converter?
- Consider transforming eGFP into _P. syringae_ strains? 
- Look up _gyrB_ and _cts_ genotyping

## Notes ##

- Worked on Malaysian manuscript:
    - Analyzed qPCR data and worked on creating heat map (see: )
- Sowed seeds:
    - Started with five flats but had only seeds for four
    - Flats 1-3: Ga-0 
        - 4 seeds/well for first half of first two
        - 2 seeds/well for second half of first two
        - 1 seed/well for first seven columns of last
    - Flats 4: Col-0 (4 seeds/well)
    - Need plants for following:
        - Ga-0 mock
        - Ga-0 BHL001
        - Ga-0 BHL002
        - Ga-0 BHL005
        - Ga-0 BHL006
        - Ga-0 BHL008
        - Ga-0 BHL009
        - Col-0 mock
        - Col-0 BHL001
    - If each well germinates successfully, 100 Ga-0 plants and 36 Col-0 plants
        - Maximum 14 replicates for Ga-0 (2 leftover)
        - Maximum 18 replicates for Col-0
        - If germination < 100%: 
            - 12 replicates for Ga-0
            - Possibly transplant to make up 98 plants?
    - Schedule:
        - Into cold room at 20130625, out of cold room 20130630 (five days of
          stratification)
        - Check daily after 20130630, thin by 20130707
        - Injection at 20130716 (three weeks after sowing)
    - Stagger next experiment to plant next week?
- Caught up on updating some lab notebook entries
