Summary: To do list, notes

## To Do ##

### Administrivia ###

- Update lab notebook entries
- Get greenhouse key for Jenny

### ASAP ###

- Take photos of serial dilutions on plates and count colonies
- For Malaysian manuscript:
    - One-sided t-test on growth curves
    - Review manuscript revisions
- Analyze .xls data (as Python and R project for student)

### Preparation ###

- Pour LB+genta plates
- biocloud install of:
    - `blast`
    - `knitr`
    - `vim-R` and dependencies
- Test confocal microscope with fluorescent strains
- Sequence knock-in genes in fluorescent strains
- Make more 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>

### Long-term ###

- Revise Python script for semiautomated colony counting
- Write a LSM to PNG converter?
- Consider transforming eGFP into _P. syringae_ strains? 
- Look up _gyrB_ and _cts_ genotyping

## Notes ##

- Imaged plates with serial dilutions (see below)
- Used ImageJ to count colonies:


- Analysis of c.f.u. as a function of OD units in R (see: )
- Inoculated 5 mL KB with single colony and incubated from 12:10 to 15:25
    - BHL001-2
    - BHL005-6
    - BHL007-8 
- Measured
