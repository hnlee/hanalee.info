## Notes ##

- Back-diluted overnight cultures of BHL001 and BHL002 but discovered KB media was contaminated
- Made 1 L of fresh KB media
- Autolaved 1 L flasks
- Inoculated 200 mL KB with cells scraped from refrigerated plates (not single colony) and incubated at 28&deg; C from 11:55 to 20:00
- Measured OD<sub>600</sub> at 16:30

Sample |OD<sub>600</sub>
-------|----------------:
BHL001 |            0.017
BHL002 |            0.010

- Prepared four flats with soil for sowing
- Printed labels for flats 006A-D
- Ran myRAST on _Xanthomonas_ genomes:
    - BR09
    - BR10
    - BR11
    - BR12
- Measured OD<sub>600</sub> at 18:00

Sample |OD<sub>600</sub>
-------|----------------:
BHL001 |            0.029
BHL002 |            0.010


- Measured OD<sub>600</sub> at 20:00

Sample |OD<sub>600</sub>
-------|----------------:
BHL001 |            0.076
BHL002 |            0.009

- BHL002 is growing too slowly so we aborted and rescheduled inoculation for tomorrow
- Adjustment of schedule to do all inoculations at 22 dps
- Inoculated 6 mL KB with single colony from refrigerated plate:
    - BHL001
    - BHL002
