##Schedule

##Notes

* Planted Ga-0 seeds in Jiffy peat pellets for four flats (third set of three)
    * See [planting schedule](20140114.html)
    * Not enough regular-sized pellets
        * One flat had five smaller pellets
        * One flat had all smaller pellets
* Put all flats in trays with drainage holes to prevent waterlogging
* Removed covers for first set of flats to combat fungal growth
* Stratified two tubes of Ga-0 seeds in 1% agarose
    * Forgot to stratify seeds yesterday!
