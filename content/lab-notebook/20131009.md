## To Do ##

### Administrivia ###

### ASAP ###

- Plate infected plant tissue
- Request seeds for initial screen

### Preparation ###

- Troubleshoot allele-specific qPCR
- Download genome sequences of _P. syringae_ isolates
- Count plated colonies
- Isolate DNA from frozen plant tissue

### Long-term ###

- Revise Python script for semiautomated colony counting
- Write a LSM to PNG converter?
- Set up infrastructure for sequence analysis

***

## Notes ##

- Pulverized plant tissue in GenoGrind at 1750 rpm for 1 m
    - Two silica beads per well
    - 500 &micro;L 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> buffer
- Added 500 &micro;L 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> and made 1:5 serial dilutions
- Plated 10 &micro;L of each dilution and incubated at room temperature
