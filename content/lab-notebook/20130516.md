Summary: To do list, LB recipe, notes, HR- reference image

## To Do ##

- Revise Python script for semiautomated colony counting
- Streak out more _Pseudomonas syringae_ strains
    - HR+:
        - RMX24.b.1
        - ME.Cv.P.105
        - ME.16.b.1
        - LP620c
    - HR-:
        - LP856.3a
        - ME.3.35.02a
        - ME812.2b
- Make freezer stocks for PNA29.1a, LP205a, ME.Cv.B50
- Remake King's B liquid media
- Make Luria Broth media
- Look up _gyrB_ and _cts_ genotyping

***

## Luria Broth (LB) media ##
(Bergelson lab recipe)

1. Combine:
    - 10 g tryptone
    - 5 g yeast extract
    - 10 g NaCl
    - 1 L ddH<sub>2</sub>O
2. For solid media, add 15 g agar
3. Autoclave.

***

## Notes ##

- Colony morphology of HR- strains:
    - "Egg yolk" morphology, where cells are more dense at the center of the
      colony than at the edge
    - Need to visualize under microscope to distinguish

"HR- colonies"){.wide500}

- Microscopes with cameras available:
    - Dissection scope in growth chamber with attachment for digital camera
    - Confocal scope in Anatomy?
- Installed local copy of Python in home directory, along with `virtualenv`,
  `pip`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas` and `PIL`
- Made 500 mL KB and 500 mL LB liquid media
- Inoculated PNA29.1a, LP205a and ME.Cv.B50 in 5 mL KB to grow for freezer
  stocks
