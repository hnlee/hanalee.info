status: draft

## To Do ##

### Administrivia ###

### ASAP ###

- Indels in Malaysian and Wine/European intergenic regions
- GEO upload

### Preparation ###

- Pour new KB+nitro plates
- SGRP reference mapping
- Troubleshoot allele-specific qPCR
- Download genome sequences of _P. syringae_ isolates
- Find optimal method for isolation of bacterial DNA from plant tissue

### Long-term ###

- Revise Python script for semiautomated colony counting
- Write a LSM to PNG converter?
- Set up infrastructure for sequence analysis

***

## Notes ##

- Restreaked BHL001 and BHL002 on KB+nitro from freezer stock (previous plates
  had genta) 
- Worked on revisions for Malaysian manuscript
- Plan for isolating bacterial DNA from plant tissue:
    - Use PureGene kit
    - Store plants dry at -20&deg; C
    - GenoGrinder 1750 rpm, possibly try up to 3 m
- Got two more HR- genomes from Talia
