## To Do ##

### Administrivia ###


### ASAP ###

- Take new gel photo of allele-specific _gyrB_ primers
- Standard curves for allele-specific qPCR

### Preparation ###

- Isolate DNA from frozen plant tissue
- Analyze _P. syringae_ clade 2 genomes for gene groups showing:
    - Enrichment of K<sub>a</sub>/K<sub>s</sub> in HR- strains
    - Enrichment of derived alleles in HR- strains
    - Enrichment of Wright F<sub>ST</sub> between HR- and HR+ strains

### Long-term ###

- Revise Python script for semiautomated colony counting
- Write a LSM to PNG converter?
- Set up infrastructure for sequence analysis
- RNAseq of strains in competition vs. monoculture?

## Notes ##

- 70 mL 1% agarose gel with TAE, precast with 7 &micro;L SYBR Safe stain

- 5 mL KB inoculated with single colony of BHL001 and BHL002
    - Incubated at 28&deg; C from 10:30 to 16:30
    - Measured OD<sub>600</sub>
    - Spun down 0.2 OD<sub>600</sub> units and resuspended in 1 mL
      ddH<sub>2</sub>O

     Strain | OD<sub>600</sub>
    --------|-----------------:
    BHL001  |             0.378
    BHL002  |             0.201

     Strain  | 0.2 OD<sub>600</sub> units (mL) 
    ---------|--------------------------------:
    BHL001   |                            0.529                    
    BHL002   |                            0.990
    combined |                    0.265 + 0.495
