Summary: To do list, notes

## To Do ##

- Revise Python script for semiautomated colony counting
- Get signature for use of confocal microscope
- Write a LSM to PNG converter?
- Streak out more _Pseudomonas syringae_ strains
    - HR+:
        - RMX24.b.1
        - ME.Cv.P.105
        - ME.16.b.1
        - LP620c
    - HR-:
        - LP856.3a
        - ME.3.35.02a
        - ME812.2b
- Look up _gyrB_ and _cts_ genotyping
- Pour LB+genta plates
- Consider transforming eGFP into _P. syringae_ strains?
- For Malaysian manuscript:
    - Supplementary table with all growth data
    - Remake growth figures with 95% confidence intervals
    - Oxidative stress phenotypes from Warringer _et al._ 
- Local install of:
    - `blast`

***

## Notes ##

- Imaged plates with bacterial colonies on dissecting scope
    - High variability between replicates
    - Talia recommends at least 8 and up to ~30 for reproducibility
