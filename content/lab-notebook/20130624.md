Summary: To do list, notes

## To Do ##

### Administrivia ###

- Hand in signed form to confocal microscope facility
- Talk to greenhouse staff to set up flats

### ASAP ###

- For Malaysian manuscript:
    - Supplementary table with all growth data
    - Remake growth figures with 95% confidence intervals
- Streak out strains from freezer stocks

### Preparation ###
 
- Pour KB+nitro and LB+genta plates
- biocloud install of:
    - `blast`
    - `knitr`
    - `vim-R` and dependencies
- PCR and sequence verification of _P. syringae_ strains
- Set up for planting Ga-0 and Col-0

### Long-term ###

- Revise Python script for semiautomated colony counting
- Write a LSM to PNG converter?
- Consider transforming eGFP into _P. syringae_ strains? 
- Look up _gyrB_ and _cts_ genotyping

## Notes ##

- Worked on Malaysian manuscript:
    - Made supplementary table with all growth data
    - Remade growth figures with 95% confidence intervals (see: )
    - Started analysis of qPCR data (see: )
- Requested five flats with soil for sowing this week
- Summer student training:
    - Experiment 1: does fluorescent label in bacteria affect growth _in
      planta_?
        - Consider doing a time course...
    - Experiment 2: does successive inoculation affect cheating behavior?
- Streaked out strains from freezer stocks
    - BHL001 and BHL002 on KB+nitro
    - BHL005, BHL006, BHL008 and BHL009 on KB+genta
