Summary: Started primer design 

##Schedule
* 10:30 - Ben's practice talk

##Notes

* Before designing primers, need to fix codon alignments
    * Previous method was to BLAST protein sequences against genomes
    * Problems:
        * Overlapping matches
        * Truncated alignments (in case of frameshift or nonsense)
    * New method:
        * BLAST gene sequences against genomes
        * Get coordinates of homologous sequences
        * Translate sequences and align amino acids
        * Match nucleotide alignment by amino acid alignment
    * Might be interesting to look at start codon choices later
    * Particularly important to get reliable alignments for _gyrB_ and _hrpL_
