    - July 4: plate pouring, spotting serial dilutions
    - July 3: colony counting, add cameraphone images, (failed) plate pouring
    - July 2: confocal microscope, add microscopy images 
    - July 1: colony counting, add cameraphone images, OD ~ cfu analysis, plating serial dilutions
    - June 28: growing bacteria, plating serial dilutions, primer design
    - June 26: add link to Rmd
    - June 25: add link to Rmd
    - June 24: add links to Rmd
    - June 17: add link to Rmd, notes on panel
    - June 13: add dissecting scope images
    - June 11: fix typo
    - June 7: fix table, add analysis results 
    - June 6: add cameraphone images
    - June 3: fix formatting
    - PCR reactions key?

### ASAP ###

- Inoculate for injections tomorrow

### Preparation ###

- biocloud install of:
    - `blast`
    - `knitr`
    - `vim-R` and dependencies
- Sequence knock-in genes in fluorescent strains

### Long-term ###

- Revise Python script for semiautomated colony counting
- Write a LSM to PNG converter?
- Consider transforming eGFP into _P. syringae_ strains? 
- Look up _gyrB_ and _cts_ genotyping

## Notes ##

- Poured 150 x 15 mm plates:
    - KB + nitro (100 &micro;g/mL)
    - KB + nitro (100 &micro;g/mL) + genta (25 &micro;g/mL)
- Checked on plants in first set of flats in greenhouse:
    - Ready for injection
    - Noted which flats had too large or too small plants
        - Too small plants will be removed from analysis
        - Too large plants will be used for mock injections
- Inoculated single colony in 5 mL KB
    - BHL001-2
    - BHL005-6
    - BHL008-9
