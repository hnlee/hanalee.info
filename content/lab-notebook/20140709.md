## Notes ##

- Gave lab meeting
    - Find gene content, match it to reference, and concatenate for SNPs
    - Genes not present in reference can go at the end, including genes unique to single strain
    - Ask Miaoyan if model can handle three levels for genotype at marker: minor allele, major allele, absence
    - Use two different references depending on population? e.g. _Xcc_ for Midwest and _raphani_ and _Xoo_ for French and _oryzae_
    - Discuss whether French should be grouped with _oryzae_ or not
    - Try higher MAF since even 10% of all 24 strains is only ~ 2 strains
    - How many SNPs present in all strains?
