## To Do ##

### Administrivia ###

### ASAP ###

- Plate lysed plant tissue
- GEO upload
- SGRP reference mapping

### Preparation ###

- Troubleshoot allele-specific qPCR
- Download genome sequences of _P. syringae_ isolates
- Find optimal method for isolation of bacterial DNA from plant tissue

### Long-term ###

- Revise Python script for semiautomated colony counting
- Write a LSM to PNG converter?
- Set up infrastructure for sequence analysis

***

## Notes ##

- Lysed plant tissue stored at 4&deg; C O/N at 1750 rpm for 1 m in
  GenoGrinder
- Added 750 &micro;L 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> and did three serial 1:4
  dilutions
- Plated 10 &micro;L of each dilution on KB+nitro plates
