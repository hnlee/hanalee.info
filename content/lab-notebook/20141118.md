1. Thaw 2N NaOH, PhiX control DNA, sequencing primers, HT1 buffer
2. Thaw reagent cartridge in H2O below max line, for 1 h at room temp, place at 4&deg; C
3. Dilute NaOH to 0.2N (100 uL 2N NaOH + 900 uL H2O)
4. Dilute pooled reactions to 4 nM 
5. Dilute PhiX control to 4 nM
6. Process PhiX and sample:
    Denature 5 uL 4 nM PhiX and 5 uL 0.2 N NaOH
    Vortex 5s and spin down
    Incubate at room temp for 5 m
7. Dilute to 20 pM
    10 uL denatured PhiX + 990 uL prechilled HT1
8. Dilute to 12.6 pM
    375 ul 20 pM PhiX + 225 uL prechilled HT1
9. Combine phiX and sample - 600 uL total
    5% phiX 30 uL
    95% sample 570 uL
10. Use 2 mL pipet tip to pierce reagent cartridge holes
    Add 600 uL sample to sample hole
    Add 5 uL 574.984.seq1 (100 uM) to 12
    Add 5 uL 574.984.bc (100 uM) to 13
    Add 5 uL 574.984.seq2 (100 uM) to 14
11. Gently shake reagent cartridge to mix
12. Note: MiSeq will need to go through three washes before sequencing

13. Create sample sheet with MiSeq template wizard - title of CSV is barcode of cartridge
14. Click 'Sequence' on MiSeq
15. Load flow cell
    Use gloves to remove flow cell from buffer
    Gently rinse with milliQ
    Dry with Kimwipe
    Spray Kimwipe with 70% EtOH
    Gently remove smudges
    Make sure dry
    Place flow cell on instrument, make sure area is free of debris
    Lower latch until it clicks
    MiSeq will recognize flow cell
16. Load PR2 (incorporation buffer) and empty waste bottle
17. Load reagent cartridge
18. Make sure MiSeq finds a sample sheet
19. MiSeq will do pre-run checks and then click start
20. Run takes about ~40 h, complete H2O wash after completing

Normalize libraries to 10 nM and pool

LB JB2-1 (diluted 1:10) 6.051 nM
KB JB2-2 (diluted 1:10) 9.8614 nM

60.51 nM to 10 nM: 24.8 uL of library in 125.2 Tris-HCl Tween-20
98.614 nM to 10 nM: 25.4 uL of library in 224.6 Tris-HCl Tween-20

12.114 g in 1 L = 10 mM
0.605 g in 50 mL
add HCl until pH8.5
0.1% Tween-20 = 50 uL
