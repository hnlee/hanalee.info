Summary: To do list, notes, plate images

## To Do ##

- Inoculate _P. syringae_ strains for growth
- Revise Python script for semiautomated colony counting
- Get signature for use of confocal microscope
- Write a LSM to PNG converter?
- Streak out more _Pseudomonas syringae_ strains
    - HR+:
        - RMX24.b.1
        - ME.Cv.P.105
        - ME.16.b.1
        - LP620c
    - HR-:
        - LP856.3a
        - ME.3.35.02a
        - ME812.2b
- Look up _gyrB_ and _cts_ genotyping
- Pour LB+genta plates
- Consider transforming eGFP into _P. syringae_ strains?
- For Malaysian manuscript:
    - Analyze raw growth data from CCC1 plasmid strains
    - Supplementary table with all growth data
    - Remake growth figures with 95% confidence intervals
    - Oxidative stress phenotypes from Warringer _et al._ 
- Local install of:
    - `blast`

## Notes ##

- Thinned out Ga-0 plants in flat to have only one plant per well
    - Google says do it as soon as hypocotyl and cotyledons are visible
    - Sow seeds closer to center?
    - Some plants looked stressed (purple leaves)
    - Left lid off to dry before injection
- Ordered:
    - GoTaq Green master mix
    - Enzyme cooler box
- Need to find:
    - Plant DNA extraction protocol recommended by the lab
    - Binder/folder for orders and receipts
- Inoculated for overnight growth in preparation for syringe injection tomorrow
- Photographed plates with Crime-Lite Blue-Green to distinguish YFP-carrying
  colonies, using clamps to hold cell phone camera
