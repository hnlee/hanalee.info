Summary: To do list, notes

## To Do ##

- Set up flats for sowing on Monday
- Plot growth curves and calculate doubling time for all replicates

### Administrivia ###

- Email about ordering RNAseq library kit

### ASAP ###


### Preparation ###

### Long-term ###

***

## Notes ##

- Filled four flats with soil
- Emailed Tim about RNAseq library kit and label-making
- Plan for RNA isolation:
    - Qiagen RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent
    - Qiagen RNeasy Plus Mini
    - Epicentre Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Bacteria
    - Maximum: 2.5 &dot; 10<sup>8</sup> cells = 0.2 OD units (approximately)
    - Need to find or prepare:
        - Magnetic stand
        - RNase-free water
        - RNase-free TE buffer
        - Lysozyme
        - 14.3 M &beta;-mercaptoethanol
        - RNase-free tips
        - RNase-free tubes
        - RNase remover spray
        - DNase I?
        - Vortexer (to move to bench)
        - 3 M NaOAc
        - RNase-free 70% EtOH
        - 100% EtOH
        - Bioanalyzer machine
- Calculated doubling times and tested if they were significantly different across strains
    - BHL001 vs. BHL002 _p_ = 0.1162
    - BHL005 vs. BHL008 _p_ = 0.1701
    - BHL008 vs. BHL009 _p_ = 0.08508
- Printed labels for stakes
