Summary: To do list, notes
status: draft

## To Do ##

### Administrivia ###

- Email Brian Traw for tips on infection

### ASAP ###

- Inoculate bacteria for overnight growth
- Streak on plates from freezer stock
- Sterilize 250 mL flasks
- Request seeds for initial screen

### Preparation ###

- Troubleshoot allele-specific qPCR
- Download genome sequences of _P. syringae_ isolates
- Count plated colonies
- Isolate DNA from frozen plant tissue

### Long-term ###

- Revise Python script for semiautomated colony counting
- Write a LSM to PNG converter?
- Set up infrastructure for sequence analysis

***

## Notes ##

- Inoculated single colonies in 5 mL liquid KB and incubated at 28&deg; C
- Some ideas for fixing infection protocol:
    - Use 0.02% Silwet L-77 to lower surface tension of bacterial solution
    - Wash hole punch in 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> after ethanol sterilization
    - Blot leaf after sterilization and wash
    - No ethanol on forceps
    - Dip leaf for short time in ethanol
    - One strain per flat, spray whole flat?
    - Mesh-covered pots and dip?
- [Useful protocol](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-62703-414-2_6)
- Obtained Silwet L-77 from Chris' bench (20 &micro;L per 100 mL)
- Autoclaved two 250 mL flasks for tomorrow
- Spray bottles (HDPE) not autoclavable, so must sterilize with ethanol
