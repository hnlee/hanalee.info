I am a software engineer, seeking to solve interesting problems through code.
I'm currently employed as a crafter at the Chicago office
of [8th Light](http://8thlight.com), a consulting group that builds custom software
and provides developer training services for its clients.

In a former life, I was a genetics and genomics researcher, with expertise in
analysis of "next-generation" sequencing and scientific computing for the life
sciences. I received my doctorate at UC Berkeley and did a postdoctoral
fellowship at University of Chicago.
