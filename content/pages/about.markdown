I am a software engineer(-in-training), currently doing a resident
apprenticeship at [8th Light](http://8thlight.com) and seeking to solve
interesting problems through code.

In a former life, I was a genetics and genomics researcher, with expertise in
analysis of "next-generation" sequencing and scientific computing for the life
sciences. I received my doctorate at UC Berkeley and did a postdoctoral
fellowship at University of Chicago.
