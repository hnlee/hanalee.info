I am a scientist interested in exploring and analyzing big data. In a
former life, I was a genetics and genomics researcher, with expertise in
analysis of "next-generation" sequencing and scientific computing for the life
sciences. I received my doctorate at UC Berkeley and did a postdoctoral
fellowship at University of Chicago. Now I am seeking to transition outside of
academia to a position in data science.

vitae](cv.html).
