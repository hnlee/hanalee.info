I am a postdoctoral researcher with Joy Bergelson's group in the Department of
Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago. My research interests focus
on using genomics to interrogate the genetic basis of ecologically relevant
traits in natural populations and gain a better understanding of evolutionary
mechanisms at the molecular level. Currently, I am investigating the effects of
host genetic background on endophytic microbial communities found in _Arabidopsis
thaliana_.
