## Notes ##

- Autoclaved toothpicks and dowels for 30 m on dry cycle
- Collected plant tissue
    - Two discs per plant, one per leaf infected, pooled together (exception:
      first PNA29.1a plant)
    - Sterilized tweezers in 70% ethanol, detached leaf from plant, sterilized
      hole punch in 70% ethanol, punched hole in leaf
    - Disc placed in 96 deep well plate w/ 200 &micro;L 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>
    - Layout:

             Wells       | Sample 
      -------------------|---------------
      A2, A3, E2, E3     |PNA29.1a
      A4, A5, E4, E5     |LP205a
      A6, A7, E6, E7     |ME.Cv.B50
      A8, A9, E8, E9     |PNA29.1a + LP205a
      A10, A11, E10, E11 |PNA29.1a + ME.Cv.B50

    - Two beads per well
    - Genogrind at 1750 rpm for 1 m
    - Spin down plates at 800 rpm for 1 m
    - Dilutions:
        - 10<super>0</super>: added 800 &micro;L 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> to rows
          A and E (original plant tissue)
        - 10<super>-2</super>: added 10 &micro;L 10<super>0</super> dilution 
          and 990 &micro;L 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> to rows B and F
        - 10<super>-4</super>: added 10 &micro;L 10<super>-2</super> dilution 
          and 990 &micro;L 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> to rows C and G
        - 10<super>-6</super>: added 10 &micro;L 10<super>-4</super> dilution 
          and 990 &micro;L 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> to rows D and H
    - Plated 50 &micro;L of dilutions from rows A-D on quarters of KB+nitro 
      plates
    - Plated 5 &micro;L of dilutions from rows E-H as spots on KB+nitro plates
    - Incubated at 28&deg; C
