## To Do ##

- Obtain Ga-0 seeds
- Learn how to infect _Arabidopsis_ with bacteria
- Streak out more _Pseudomonas syringae_ strains
    - HR+:
        - RMX24.b.1
        - ME.Cv.P.105
        - ME.16.b.1
        - LP620c
    - HR-:
        - LP856.3a
        - ME.3.35.02a
        - ME812.2b
- Look up _gyrB_ and _cts_ genotyping

## Syringe infiltration of _Arabidopsis thaliana_ ##

1. Inoculate single colony into 5 mL KB. Grow at 28&deg; C with shaking.
2. Back-dilute 500 &micro;L into 5 mL KB. Grow at 28&deg; C with shaking for
   3-4 h.
3. Spin down 500 &micro;L at 5000 rpm for 5 m. Resuspend in 1 mL 10 mM 
   MgSO<sub>4</sub>.
4. Measure OD<sub>600</sub>.
5. Dilute to 2.5 * 10<super>5</super> cells/mL in 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>.
    - Total volume needed is ~ 1 mL/leaf or ~ 20 mL/16 leaves.
    - OD<sub>600</sub> 0.2 = 2.5 * 10<super>8</super> cells/mL, so dilute to
      final OD<sub>600</sub> 0.0002
6. Mark leaf to infect.
7. Fill syringe with inoculum. Make sure there are no air bubbles.
8. Infiltrate from bottom side of the leaf. Let air dry.
9. Place dome without holes over flat and tape down. Make sure plants are 
   bottom-watered.
10. Remove infected leaf with tweezers and dip in 70% ethanol for 10-20 s.
11. Take hole punch from each leaf. Let air dry and pat with paper towel.
12. Place discs in 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>.
13. Grind discs with Genogrinder at 1750 rpm for 30 s. Vortex at maximum
    setting for 30 s. Spin down at 800 rpm for 1 m.
14. Make serial dilutions and plate.

## Notes ##

- Practicing injections

    - _Pseudomonas syringae_ strains:
        - PNA29.1a
        - LP205a
        - ME.Cv.B50
    - Back-diluted 500 &micro;L of overnight cultures into 5 mL KB
    - Incubated at 28&deg; C with shaking starting at 09:50
    - Made 50 mL and 500 mL of 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, diluted from 
      1 M MgSO<sub>4</sub> stock and filter-sterilized
    - Stopped incubation at 12:47 and resuspended in 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>
    - Took OD<sub>600</sub> on spectrophotometer (note: spectrophotometer
      needs to be warmed up  \>15 m in advance)

      Strain   |OD<sub>600</sub>  
      ---------|---------------:
      PNA29.1a |    0.087
      LP205a   |    0.119
      ME.Cv.B50|    0.084

    - Diluted to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.0002 in total volume of 20 mL

      Strain              |Culture (mL) |10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> (mL)
      --------------------|------------:|--------------------------:
      PNA29.1a            |        0.046|                     19.954
      LP205a              |        0.034|                     19.966
      ME.Cv.B50           |        0.048|                     19.952
      PNA29.1a + LP205a   |0.023 + 0.017|                     19.960
      PNA29.1a + Me.Cv.B50|0.023 + 0.024|                     19.953

    - Tip from Madlen: easier to fill syringe if flasks are at maximum volume
    - Syringes available at the greenhouse room
    - Marked leaves with marker in advance, aiming for leaves of similar size
      and age (midway through rosette spiral)
    - Injected two leaves per four plants per strain/strain combination
      (injected extra leaves for some plants for additional practice)
    - Tips from Madlen: 
        - keep syringe perpendicular to leaf surface, bracing against finger
        - inject at tip of leaf, on either side of midrib
        - mark at midrib near base of leaf
        - avoid using too much pressure as it will wound the leaf
    - Covered with plastic dome (available in planting room)

- Received Ga-0 seeds from Tim
