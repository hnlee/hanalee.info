- Streak out more _Pseudomonas syringae_ strains
    - HR+:
        - RMX24.b.1
        - ME.Cv.P.105
        - ME.16.b.1
        - LP620c
    - HR-:
        - LP856.3a

        - ME812.2b
- Make freezer stocks for PNA29.1a, LP205a, ME.Cv.B50
- Autoclave toothpicks and dowels 
- Look up _gyrB_ and _cts_ genotyping

***

## Seed-planting protocol ##

1. Put seeds in 0.1% agarose.
2. Water the surface of the soil.
3. Use Pasteur pipette to position seeds (~ 5 seeds/well).
4. Put in dark cold room to stratify.

***

## 0.1% agarose ##

1. Combine:
    - 0.2 g agarose
    - 200 mL ddH<sub>2</sub>O
2. Heat until dissolved.

***

## Notes ##

- Made 0.1% agarose solution
- Planted Ga-0 seeds and put flat in cooler (stratifying for 6 d until 2013 May 
  16)
