Summary: Useful links related to bash and functional programming 

For someone who once had to exclusively use Linux at work for several years, my
knowledge of bash is extremely mediocre. Luckily, there are a wide range of
references and tutorials out there.

[Explain Shell](http://explainshell.com/): Type in any command line and have it
broken down and explained, piece by piece.

[tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr): A more readable version of `man`
pages for commonly used commands.

[Command Line Crash
Course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html): Mostly covers
the basics that I already knew, but it's still a good place to get started. 

[Humble Bundle Unix Books](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/unix-book-bundle):
This bundle is still active for about four more days and includes pretty much
all the O'Reilly guides you would ever need. I've been meaning to purchase the
one on `sed` and `awk` for a while now since I don't know how to use either.

And now for the functional programming half...

[Functional Programming Design
Patterns](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/fppatterns/): Slides and video for a
talk on functional programming design patterns, which was linked in the [8th
Light](http://8thlight.com) company Slack. I didn't entirely digest a lot of the
principles he describes in the talk, so it's definitely a link I hope to
revisit and ponder more deeply.

[OO vs FP](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/11/24/FPvsOO.html): Blog
post by Uncle Bob, in part a reaction to the above. It lays out the case that
object-oriented programming and functional programming are not such
fundamentally different paradigms and that the same design patterns used in
object-oriented programming can be used in functional programming as well.

[Adopting FP: The Good, the Familiar, the
Unknown](https://speakerdeck.com/trptcolin/adopting-fp-the-good-the-familiar-and-the-unknown):
Talk given by our CTO at the inaugural [Chicago Software Craftsmanship
Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoSC/). Also makes a similar case that a lot
of the design principles and patterns from object-oriented programming may be
transferrable or have their equivalents in functional programming.
