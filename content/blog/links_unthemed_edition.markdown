Summary: Useful miscellaneous links

This time, my list follows no particular theme, but here are some links that
I've collected lately and found interesting:

[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/): Guide to how semantic versioning
works.

[A Study Plan to Cure Javascript Fatigue](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/a-study-plan-to-cure-javascript-fatigue-8ad3a54f2eb1#.n4fw8yqll):
This post provides a pretty good guide for how to
learn Javascript, starting with React, ES6, Redux, and
GraphQL. Dealing with the front-end user interactive functionality on my current
project has made me realize how useful Javascript can be, and I think
the resources in this post will come in useful for any future web development
projects.

[20 Weird & Wonderful Datasets for Machine Learning](https://medium.com/@olivercameron/20-weird-wonderful-datasets-for-machine-learning-c70fc89b73d5#.tid0gfng7): Always worth having links to any useful open data sets. I'm particularly interested in the mushroom one, which could make for a fun side project.

[`git reflog`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog): I made a mistake during
rebasing and thought I had lost all the changes I had made on the branch. My
mentor suggested that I check `git reflog`, which completely saved me from the
horrible prospect of having to repeat a good two or three hours of work.
Resolved to be more vigilant about rebasing in the future, but in the meantime,
I am glad that there's always a backup somewhere in `git`, as long as you
remember to commit.
